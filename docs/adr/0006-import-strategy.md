# 6. Cluster Import Strategy

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2023-06-01
- Authors: @richardcase
- Deciders: @richardcase

## Context

Clusters that are provisioned via Cluster API (CAPI) will need to be made available via Rancher Manager. There is a feature of Rancher Manager that allows you to **import** an existing cluster.

## Decision

The operator will replicate the steps that a user would perform if they were importing an existing cluster via the Rancher Manager UI including applying the manifests available via the import endpoint for the newly imported cluster.

It has also been decided that we will not use the import feature of v2prov. The v2prov import feature will restrict us to always having the CAPI Management be the same as the Rancher Manager Cluster and this restriction would mean we cannot support different deployment topologies as covered in the strategy. See [ADR004](./0004-running-out-of-rancher-manager-cluster.md) for further details of running the operator in a different cluster.

## Consequences

To replicate the import steps the operator will need to:

- Create an instance of **provisioning.cattle/v1.Cluster** in the Rancher Manager cluster
- Wait for the **ClusterRegistrationToken** to be created AND contain an import url
- Download the import manifests using the URL from the **ClusterRegistrationToken**
- Use the kubeconfig generated by CAPI for the cluster and apply the import manifests to the cluster created by CAPI.
  - This will deploy the Rancher Cluster agent which will then connect back to Rancher Manager
